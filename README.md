# Iris-NN
Feed-forward neural-network classifier for the Iris dataset from scratch using Python. No prepackaged libraries (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, etc.) are used to construct the neural network. Instead, the classifier is built manually, using mathematical fundamentals. Scikit-learn is used only for data extraction to simplify preprocessing, as the Iris dataset is built into the library.
